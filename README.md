# Scout Stream App (End-user Prototype)

This is a proof-of-concept mobile application designed to demonstrate Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Extended Advertising data scanning on iOS devices.

This app serves a primarily visual purposeâ€”allowing users to see how extended advertising packets are received, parsed, and displayed in real time. It helps validate the capability and behavior of iOS BLE stacks when handling larger advertising payloads.
